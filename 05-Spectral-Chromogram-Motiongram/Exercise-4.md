Exercise 4.1

On the (./data)[] folder you will find three signals:

1. changingSonusoids. wav
2. trumpetFu11. wav
3. roy.wav

The first signal is stationary, except for the few times where the frequency changes. 

On the other hand, the last signal contains a speech signal and is, therefore, quickly changing. 

The second signal is in between these two signals in complexity.

We would like to compute the spectrogram of these three signals. We will do this using three windows: 

1. rectangular window
2. hann window
3. truncated Gaussian window

For each of these windows, compute spectrograms of the three signals. Experiment with the window length, the amount of overlap, and the DPT length. Is there a setup which works well for all signals?
